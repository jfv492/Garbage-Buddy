# Garbage-Buddy
Microcontroller Systems Design Project using the STM32F103RB microcontroller 

<h3>ðŸ’¡Introduction </h3>
<p> This project is intended construct a smart garbage bin controlled by the STM32F103RB. In recent times we have been trying to follow the hygienic practices amid the COVID-19 pandemic and 
    still continue to take precautions whenever we can. There are many items in our household that contains 
    high amount of unhygienic substances which go unnoticed; a garbage bin being 
    one of them. A garbage bin holds probably the most amount of bacteria as all the waste of the household is 
    dumped there. </p>
